Using Monte Carlo Simulation
It is a software which would ask the user how much time
they will take to finish a task and then when the user finishes the
task, the actual time taken is recorded. The ratio of the actual time to
the estimated time will then be run through a Monte Carlo
simulation to get a range of deadlines with levels of confidence.
